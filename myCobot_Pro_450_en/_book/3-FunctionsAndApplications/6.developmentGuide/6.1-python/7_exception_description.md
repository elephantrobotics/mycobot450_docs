# Checking And Handling Robot Arm Exceptions

When the robot arm fails to execute a motion command, you can query the corresponding exception information in the Python terminal, for example.

## Reading Robot Status

### Status Feedback Analysis

Under normal circumstances, this interface returns all 0s. Reading the robot status is as follows:

```python
from pymycobot import Pro450Client
# The default IP address is "192.168.0.232" and the default port number is 4500
pro450 = Pro450Client('192.168.0.232', 4500)

if pro450.is_power_on() !=1:
    pro450.power_on()  # Power on

pro450.get_robot_status() # Reading Robot Status

```

Return:

```bash
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Indicates the robot is not moving, no joints are exceeding limits, no joint hardware errors, and no joint software errors.

A complete explanation of each value is as follows:

`[Reserved, Whether Moving, Whether J1 Exceeds Limits, Whether J2 Exceeds Limits, Whether J3 Exceeds Limits, Whether J4 Exceeds Limits, Whether J5 Exceeds Limits, Whether J6 Exceeds Limits, Whether J1 Motor Hardware Error, Whether J2 Motor Hardware Error, Whether J3 Motor Hardware Error, Whether J4 Motor Hardware Error, Whether J5 Motor Hardware Error, Whether J6 Motor Hardware Error, Whether J1 Software Communication Error, Whether J2 Software Communication Error, Whether J3 Software Communication Error, Whether J4 Software Communication Error, Whether J5 Software Communication Error, Whether J6 Software Communication Error]`

The following example is as follows:

```bash
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This indicates that the robot reported an error during movement, with J4 reporting a control error.

```bash
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This indicates that robot J2 exceeded the limit.

```bash
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
```

Indicates that the robot's J5 line is abnormal - receiving an error

### Exception Resolution

#### Joint Out Of Limit

When a joint exceeds the limit, use one of the following solutions:

- Execute the over-limit return to zero interface:

```bash
pro450.over_limit_return_zero() #The robot will return to the origin at a slower speed
```

- Execute joint relaxation and manually move the joint to within the limit

```bash
pro450.set_motor_enable(254, 0)
```

#### Joint Hardware Error

Most hardware errors can be recovered using exception recovery.

```bash
pro450.servo_restore(joint_id)
```

If this problem persists after using exception recovery or restarting the robot, please contact our engineers. Detailed information about the hardware errors for each joint is shown:

| Bit (2 bytes) | Error Status |
| :-----------: | :---------: |
| 0 | CAN bus error. Exception recovery possible. If recovery is not possible, check the communication line, repair it, and then power on again. |
| 1 | Short circuit. Exception recovery possible. |
| 2 | Invalid setting data |
| 3 | Control error. Exception recovery possible. |
| 4 | CAN communication error. Exception recovery possible. If recovery is not possible, check the communication line, repair it, and then power on again. |
| 5 | Feedback error. Exception recovery possible. |
| 6 | Positive limit switch active. |
| 7 | Negative limit switch active. |
| 8 | Negative limit switch active. |
| 9 | Overcurrent. Exception recovery possible. |
| 10 | 12t protection. Exception recovery possible. Overtemperature. Exception recovery possible. |
| 11 | Driver board overtemperature. Exception recovery possible. |
| 12 | Overvoltage. Exception recovery possible. |
| 13 | Undervoltage, exception recovery possible |
| 14 | Command error |
| 15 | Enable inactive |

#### Joint Software Errors

Software error feedback mainly includes: circuit abnormalities, CAN module abnormalities, encoder abnormalities, and enable failure. If the enable failure occurs, use `pro450.set_motor_enable(254, 1)` to enable motion again. For other abnormalities, please contact our engineers. Detailed joint software error information is shown:

| Bit (1 byte) | Error Status 1 - Abnormal 0 - Normal |
| :-----------: | :---------: |
| 0 | CAN initialization error. Check the main control board. After repairing the control board error, power cycle. Symptoms: The machine cannot be enabled or controlled. |
| 1 | Motor initialization error. Check the motor communication circuit. After repairing the error, power cycle. Symptoms: The machine cannot properly feedback joint information or control. |
| 2 | Motor transmission error. Check the motor communication circuit. Symptoms: Machine position feedback error. Can be cleared using error recovery. |
| 3 | Motor reception error. Check the motor communication circuit. Symptoms: Machine position feedback error. Can be cleared using error recovery. This feedback allows normal machine control and does not require user notification. It is mainly used for troubleshooting. |
| 4 | Position error. Check the motor encoder. Symptoms: The machine is disabled and motion control is impossible. Can be cleared using error recovery. |
| 5 | Terminal transmission error. Check the terminal communication line, etc. Symptom: Terminal interface feedback error. Can be cleared using error recovery. |
| 6 | Terminal reception error. Check the terminal communication line, etc. Symptom: Terminal interface feedback error. Can be cleared using error recovery. This feedback allows normal machine control without prompting the user and is primarily used for troubleshooting. |
| 7 | Motor encoder error. When the encoder reports an error, movement is disabled. Clear the encoder error. Older motor driver boards do not report errors—even if an encoder error is reported, the software does not report the error. How to distinguish newer boards: The board with the battery is a new driver board. |
| 8 | Feedback will be generated when the enable is turned off. The machine must be enabled before movement. |

#### The robot is in motion and cannot move.

The robot is in motion and does not respond when you send a motion point. Please stop the robot by executing `pro450.stop()` and `pro450.resume()`. If the robot still cannot move, please contact our engineers. <br/>
