# One-step execution

The so-called single-step execution refers to: single-block execution. When there are a large number of building blocks in the workspace, I only want to execute one of them to see what effect it will have. At this point, single-step execution can be used

**One-step** button is disabled by default and cannot be clicked.

**Step 1:** Drag several setting joint blocks into the workspace.
