**myStudio Pro** is a one-stop robot programming and control software that supports visual programming interaction, quick motion control, drag-based tutorials, and robot status query and configuration. *myStudio Pro* includes the `myBlockly` module.

**myBlockly** is similar in function and design to MIT's children's programming language, Scratch.

With **myBlockly**, users can construct code logic by dragging blocks, much like building blocks.

From a user's perspective, **myBlockly** is a simple and easy-to-use visual code generation tool. From a developer's perspective, **myBlockly** is a text box containing user-entered code.

Generating code in the text box is similar to dragging code into myBlockly in **myStudio Pro**.
