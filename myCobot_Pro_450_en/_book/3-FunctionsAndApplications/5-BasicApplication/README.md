# First-time Use Guide For The Robot Arm
## Installation Method
1.Before you begin assembly, clean your work surface and gather the necessary tools.

  - Working Environment: Place the robot horizontally on a table capable of supporting at least three times the robot's own weight and within the robot's working range, with ample space for installation, use, maintenance, and repair.

  - Tool List: mycobot pro 450 robot, accessory kit, user guide, etc.

2.Place the robot arm flat on the table and position it towards the edge of the table, securing it with a G-clamp.

3.After the structure is installed, the next step of power connection can be carried out.

> **Note:**
> 1. When adjusting the robot's position on the base mounting platform, do not push or pull the robot directly on the base mounting platform to avoid scratches.
> 2. When manually moving the robot, do not apply external force to vulnerable parts of the robot to avoid unnecessary damage.

## Connect Power

> Tools required: mycobot pro 450 robotic arm with a pre-installed base mounting platform, 24V DC power supply, emergency stop button, etc.

> **Note:**
> 1. Please ensure that you have completed the above structural installation and secure the base of the robotic arm to the desktop to ensure safe operation.
> 2. Please follow the steps below to connect the power adapter to the corresponding port on the robotic arm:

Step  1：
Connect a DC power supply (make sure to use the official adapter, or a DC power supply with a DC24V 15A or higher) to the corresponding DC round connector on the mycobot pro 450 robot arm. Connect the other end of the adapter to a 110-220V power outlet.
