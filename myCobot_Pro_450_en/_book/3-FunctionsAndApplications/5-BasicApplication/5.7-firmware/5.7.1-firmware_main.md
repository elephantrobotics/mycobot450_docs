myCobotPro450 supports users to remotely upgrade and burn the latest version of the terminal firmware. The machine uses the latest version of the firmware by default when it leaves the factory. If a new version of the firmware is released later, you only need to keep the network connection open when using myStudio, and myStudio will automatically download the latest version of the firmware.
