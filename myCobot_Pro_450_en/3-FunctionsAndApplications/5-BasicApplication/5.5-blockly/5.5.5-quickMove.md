# Rapid Move

What is **Rapid Move**? Simply put, it allows you to quickly control robot movement with mouse clicks, without programming.

> Note: There are two **Rapid Move** control panels in myStudio, and their functions are similar.

**Step 1: Click the Rapid Move** button to open the **Rapid Move** panel and wait for the robot data to be returned.

If all data is zero, please check that the robotic arm is connected and functioning properly.

**Step 2:** Try clicking the `-` / `+` buttons to control different joints of the robotic arm.

**Step 3:** Control the coordinates.

First, move Joint 3 to approximately -90 degrees, as shown below.

Then, click the  `-` / `+`  buttons for different coordinate axes to control the coordinates.

For other functions, please refer to [Quick Move](../5.1.6-quickmove/5.1.6.1-quickmovefirstuse.md)
