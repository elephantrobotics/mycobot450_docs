# Preparing to use myStudio Pro

1. Hardware Configuration. Before using myStudio Pro, ensure the machine is powered on and the server program is running, including the `nginx` service. `nginx` automatically starts when the machine is powered on by default. To ensure the normal use of myStudio Pro, you can access the system using an `SSH` connection and enter the following command in the terminal.
   
   ```bash
      nginx
   ```
   > By default, myStudio runs on port 80. You can also modify the service running port by modifying the corresponding configuration file.

2. Software Configuration. Before using myStudio Pro, please make sure you have installed a browser on your computer.
