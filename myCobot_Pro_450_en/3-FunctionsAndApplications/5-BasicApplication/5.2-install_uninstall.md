2. The correct access IP and port are obtained.
3. Use a modern browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Safari to access the system.

- If the page doesn't update, try clearing the cache and refreshing (shortcut: Ctrl + F5).

## Uninstall

- If you no longer need to use it, simply stop the robotic arm system's web service or delete the relevant bookmarks/cache in your browser.

## Access method

- Ensure the device and the robotic arm are on the same local area network.
- Enter the following in the browser address bar:
  
  ```bash
  http://<Robot system IP>:<Port number>
  ```
- Once the page is loaded successfully, you can use the system without installing an additional client.
