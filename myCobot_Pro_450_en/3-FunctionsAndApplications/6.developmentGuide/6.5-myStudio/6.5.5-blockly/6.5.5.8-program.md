# Program Control

Before starting

> 1. Make sure the robotic arme is powered on.
> 
> 2. Ensure that the robotic arm is properly connected.

This chapter introduces how to debug block code through the `Run Panel` to achieve program `Pause`, `Restore`, `One-step`, and `Stop`.

Edit a program to control the movement of the mechanical arm joint 1.

Click the `Run Plane` button. When the Run panel pops up, click `Run All` button and immediately click the `Pause` button. The program will pause after executing the first instruction `mc.send_angle(1,0,20)`

The program has been suspended. The next instruction to be executed, `time.sleep(3)`, appears

At this moment

If the `Restore` button is clicked, the program will automatically proceed.

If the `One-step` button is clicked, the program will execute the next instruction, namely `mc.send_angle(1,-90,20)`;

If the `Stop` button is clicked, the program will be terminated.

As for how to proceed next, it's up to you to decide!
