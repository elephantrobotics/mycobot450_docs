# Preparations Before Using myStudio



1. Hardware configuration. Before using myStudio, please make sure your machine is powered on and the server program is enabled, and also ensure that the 'nginx' service is started. 'nginx' starts automatically by default when the machine is powered on. To ensure the normal use of myStudio, you can access the system via ssh connection and enter the following command in the terminal at the same time.
  
   ```bash
   nginx
   ```
   > myStudio runs by default on port 80. Of course, you can also achieve the effect of modifying the service running port by modifying the corresponding configuration file.

2. Software configuration. Before using myStudio, please make sure that a browser has been installed on your computer.
