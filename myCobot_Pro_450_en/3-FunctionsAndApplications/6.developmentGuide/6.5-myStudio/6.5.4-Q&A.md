# Q&A

This chapter lists common problems in using myBlockly to control the robot arm for reference.

**Q1: ​​myBlockly reports an error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymycobot'` when running **

A: This is because the pymycobot library is not installed when setting up the Python environment. To install the pymycobot library, open the terminal (Win key + R key), enter: `pip install pymycobot --upgrade --user`, and press Enter to display Successfully installed pymycobot.

**Q2: The robot arm is unresponsive due to the lack of a `sleep` method module**

A: The program that operates the robot arm movement takes time to complete, so a `sleep` module needs to be connected after an action to give the robot arm time to move before the next movement (the required time depends on the situation, and the robot arm is set by default to run myBlockly with a minimum sleep time of no less than 0.5s), otherwise the robot arm will not be able to achieve the desired movement.

**Q3: Can't open it after entering the IP address?**

A: Make sure the PC and the robotic arm are in the same local area network. Try changing the browser (Chrome/Edge is recommended) and refresh the cache (Ctrl + F5).
