# Program Control

Before starting

> 1. Make sure the robotic arme is powered on.

> 2. Ensure that the robotic arm is properly connected.

This chapter introduces how to debug block code through the "Run Panel" to achieve program pause, single-step execution, and stop.

Edit a program to control the movement of the mechanical arm joint 1.

Click the `Run` button. When the Run panel pops up, immediately click the 'Pause' button. The program will pause after executing the first instruction 'mc.send_angle(1,0,20)'

The program has been suspended. The next instruction to be executed, 'time.sleep(3)', appears

At this moment

If the "Restore" button is clicked, the program will automatically proceed.

If the "single-step execution" button is clicked, the program will execute the next instruction, namely 'mc.set_color(255,0,0)';

If the "Stop" button is clicked, the program will be terminated.

As for how to proceed next, it's up to you to decide!
