# ROS1 Environment Setup

This tutorial provides two methods for setting up an Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS1 development environment:

- **Method 1: Importing a Virtual Machine Image (Recommended)** → Quickest way to get started, with a complete built-in environment
- **Method 2: Customizing the Installation Environment** → Building from scratch, suitable for users who require flexible customization

## Method 1: Importing a Virtual Machine Image

> **Recommended**: This is the quickest method and suitable for beginners.
> **Note:** To simplify environment setup, we will provide a Linux system image (Ubuntu 20.04), the Virtual Box installation package, and its extensions. The following instructions will show you how to install Virtual Box and import the Linux system image (the default user is `u202`, and the default password is `123`).
> **Built-in Environment:** ROS1 + Moveit + Git + pymycobot + mycobot_ros

### 1 Install virtual machine

- Go to [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to download virtual machine Virtual Box

### 6 ROS installation

The basic development environment setup requires the installation of the robot operating system ROS, MoveIt, and git version manager. The following describes their installation methods and processes.

For **myCobot Pro 450** devices, please refer to the installation methods and processes described below. 

Here we choose Ubuntu 20.04, and the corresponding ROS version is ROS Melodic

>NOTE: We currently do not provide any reference for installing ROS on Windows. If necessary, please refer to [https://www.ros.org/install/](https://www.ros.org/install/)

#### 6.1 Start installation

##### 1 Add source

There is no ROS software source in the software source list of Ubuntu itself, so you need to **configure the ROS software source to the software list warehouse** before you can download ROS. Open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), enter the following command:

- Official source:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

- If the download speed is slow, it is recommended to select a mirror source nearby to replace the above command. For example, Tsinghua University is:
  
```bash
sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ros/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

You will be asked to enter the user password here. Just enter the user password you set when installing Ubuntu.

##### 2 Set up the secret key

**Configure the public network secret key**. This step is to let the system confirm that our path is safe, so that there is no problem downloading the file, otherwise it will be deleted immediately after downloading:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
```

The execution results are shown below:：

<img src =../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/ROS1/install-ros-1.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

##### 3 Installation

After adding a new software source, you need to **update the software source list**, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Execute **Install ROS**, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command according to your Ubuntu version:

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

It is recommended to install the complete ROS to prevent missing libraries and dependencies.

**The installation process takes a long time, please be patient**

- If the following error message appears in the console terminal during the installation, you need to change the software source list in `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

<img src =../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/ROS1/install-ros-2.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

- Open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command:
  
```bash
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

- Replace all official software sources in sources.list with the following Alibaba Cloud software sources:

**Ubuntu 20.04：**

```bash
deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse

deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse

deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

- Enter the command to install ROS in the console terminal:
  
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

**The installation process takes a long time, please wait patiently**

##### 4 Configure ROS environment to the system

rosdep allows you to easily install the source code you want to compile or the system dependencies required by some ROS core components. Execute the following commands in the terminal in sequence to open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>).

If rosdep is not installed on your system, please use the command `sudo apt install python-rosdep` to install it.

If your installed Ubuntu system is version 20.04, please use the command `sudo apt install python3-rosdep` to install it, and execute the rosdep initialization command after completion.
<!-- <img src =../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/ROS1/install-ros-4.png
width ="500"  align = "center"> -->

**Initialize rosdep**:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```

If the error message shown below appears:

<img src =../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/ROS1/install-ros-5.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

**Solution:** Modify the hosts file and enter the following command in the console terminal:

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/hosts
```

At the end of the file content, add the IP addresses of the following two websites to access:

```bash
199.232.28.133 raw.githubusercontent.com
151.101.228.133 raw.github.com
```

<img src =../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/ROS1/install-ros-6.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

After the modification is completed, execute in the console terminal:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```

```bash
rosdep update
```

After initialization is completed, in order to avoid the need to re-validate the ROS function path every time the terminal window is closed, we can **configure the path to the environment variable**, so that the ROS function path can be automatically validated every time a new terminal is opened.
Execute the following commands in the terminal in sequence to open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):

#### 6.2 Set up the ros environment

Execute the following command:

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc  
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 6.3 Install ROS additional dependencies

Enter the following command in the terminal to install ROS additional dependencies and open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 
sudo apt install ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui   
```

#### 6.4 Verify the installation

The startup of the ROS system requires a ROS Master, i.e., a node manager. We can start the ROS Master by entering the roscore command in the terminal.

To verify whether ROS is successfully installed, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
roscore
```

When the following interface is displayed, it means that ROS is installed successfully

<img src =../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/ROS1/install-ros-7.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

The roscore command starts a node manager, which is used for node management. In a ros system, there is only one node manager, which is the prerequisite for the operation of the ros node. Therefore, before starting the ros node, the first step is to execute roscore.


For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the official installation guide at: [http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

### 9  mycobot_ros installation

`mycobot_ros` is a ROS package launched by ElephantRobotics, which is compatible with its desktop six-axis robot arm mycobot series.

项目地址：[http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros](http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros)

#### 9.1 Prerequisites

Before installing the package, please ensure that you have a ros workspace.

Here we give a sample command for creating a workspace, the default is `catkin_ws`, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command in the command line:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src # Create a folder
cd ~/catkin_ws/src # Enter the folder
catkin_init_workspace # Initialize the current directory as a ROS workspace
cd .. # Return to the parent directory
catkin_make # Build the code in the workspace.
```

**Add workspace environment**

The official default ROS1 workspace is `catkin_ws`.

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 9.2 Installation

**NOTE:**

- This package depends on ROS and MoveIT. Please make sure that ROS and MoveIT are installed successfully before use.
- The interaction between this package and the real robot arm depends on PythonApi - `pymycobot`
- The Api project is: [https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)
- Quick installation: `pip install pymycobot --upgrade`
