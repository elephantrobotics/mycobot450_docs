# Transportation And Storage

## Packing And Packaging

&emsp;&emsp;When packing and packaging the robot product, please make sure to use packaging materials and boxes designed for it. These materials can provide sufficient cushioning and support to prevent impact and vibration during transportation. Be sure to check that all parts are properly fixed to avoid looseness and damage. For fragile or sensitive parts, additional anti-vibration protection materials should be used for reinforcement. Finally, make sure that the outside of the packaging box is marked with clear handling and warning labels to indicate the correct handling method and storage direction.

## Logistics And Transportation

&emsp;&emsp;During transportation, the robot product should be transported in the original packaging. During transportation, it should be ensured that the robot product is stable as a whole in the packaging box and protected by appropriate measures. During transportation and long-term storage, the ambient temperature should be maintained in the range of -20 to +55°C, and the humidity should be ≤95% without condensation.

&emsp;&emsp;Because the robot is a precision machine, the robot product should be handled with care when it is removed from the packaging. During transportation, if it is not placed stably, it may cause vibration and damage the internal parts of the robot.

## Equipment Storage

&emsp;&emsp;After transportation, the original packaging should be properly stored in a dry place, the ambient temperature should be kept within the range of -20 to +55°C, the humidity should be ≤95% and there should be no condensation, in preparation for future repackaging and transportation needs. Do not stack other items on the original packaging box of the robot arm to prevent deformation of the packaging box and damage to the robot arm.
